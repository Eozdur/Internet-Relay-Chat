# FT_IRC
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based communication protocol on the Internet. It offers real-time messaging that can be either public or private. Users can exchange direct messages and join group channels. IRC clients connect to IRC servers to join channels, and these servers are interconnected to form a network.

Create your own IRC server in C++, fully compatible with official clients.
